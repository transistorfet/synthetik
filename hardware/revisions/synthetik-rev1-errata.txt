 
Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the mixer is wired quite incorrectly.  The non-inverting inputs are tied to ground when they should be tied to a 2.5V reference.
  As a result, there is no sound.  Added two 10k resistors and a 10uF capacitor with a jumper wire to the exposed pins to fix it

- the trim potentiometers are mounted upside down for what they should be

- the volume potentiometer is too far back on the board.  The actual part number I ordered doesn't have the anchor pins

- the mixer doesn't work properly.  With only the YM3438 connected, and the mixer resistors replaced with 2.2k, and the op amp
  feedback resistors changed to 4.7k, that one chip is producing sound.  I also removed the YM3812 trim pot and cut the trace
  between the mixer inputs to isolate it so it didn't interfere



- there is a humming and I haven't figured out what's causing it yet
