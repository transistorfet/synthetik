Synthetik
=========

###### *Started October 21, 2020*

This project started after I bought some old sound synthesis chips that were commonly used in
video game consoles and computers from the 80s and early 90s.  The first revision is a shield
for an Arduino Mega with 4 different chips: the General Instruments AY-3-8910 / Yamaha YM2149,
the YM2612 / YM3438 (OPN), the YM3812 (OPL2), and the YMF262 (OPL3).  It also has a MIDI in
port, line out stereo jack, and a headphone stereo jack with a TDA1308 power amplifier.

The board design had a large number of issues and mistakes, and I've so far only got it working
with one chip.
