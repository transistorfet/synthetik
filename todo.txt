- So this is the data using a 3.58MHz clock.  The adlib/soundblaster used a 14.31818 which is exactly 4 times higher.
  At the higher clock, octave 0 would instead be octave 4

C4 - 262Hz:
write 0x20 0x01 to select 0 frequency multiple
write 0xa0 0xae
write 0xb0 0x32
(select octave 0 and f-number 0x2ae)
